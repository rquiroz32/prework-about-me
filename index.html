      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hey my name is Rich, I work at a software company. Spent the last few years as a quality assurance engineer (software tester) and have recently been pushed into a more administrative role due to organizational needs. I've worked in software compapnies since getting out of college, starting in sales, and then moving to QA, then as a Scrum Master, back to QA, and now in this administrative role as a liason between customer/support and our development resources.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm from Hillsborough, NJ and my family is from the Dominican Republic</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy video games (primarily Tekken), messing around on guitar, and lately learning to code :)</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>No idea yet, really just looking to have the ability to be both creative and make a solid income</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Hillsborough</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Not sure that I do, but Javascript is a language in high demand for QA positions (which would be easier for me to get into) although the prospect of being a web developer is definitely interesting. Again I like the idea of being given freedom to be creative in a professional environment.</p>
